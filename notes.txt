While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!

-Attempting to predict what passengers were transported off the Spaceship Titani
c
-Variables
-- PassengerId - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always. (multiple variables need splitting)
-- HomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence. (nominal, discrete | change to number)
-- CryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins. (nominal (binary),discrete | change to 0 and 1) 
-- Cabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard. (multiple variables need splitting)
-- Destination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to. (nominal, discrete | change to number)
-- Age - The age of the passenger.
-- VIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.
-- RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.
-- Name - The first and last names of the passenger.
-- Transported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.
